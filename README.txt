Description:
This application calculates the days between specified dates. It has a list of the 10 federal holidays recognized by the United States. 

Use of the program:

The program is simple.
Insert dates in the format Days/Mon/Year in the top right. Nearly all symbols may be used to separate the dates EXCEPT for a period. The program intakes cannot separate what it thinks is a number.


If you wish to know a date from today, you can also input the word "today" in any format. It can be uppercase, lowercase, or mismatched case, it will input the first or second date as today at the moment it is ran. 

Use the DAYS button to calculate the days.
Use the RESET button to reset all fields.

You can use the holiday option menu to see how far we are from your favorite holiday. Once the holiday has been clicked, the program will automatically place the days until the NEXT time the holiday will occur. I felt it was uneccessary for the program to show how many days since the previous holiday, therefore it will only show time to the next holiday. If it is asked for, I can add functionality to view how long since the last given holiday.

Note to the user:
Please let me know if you find any bugs and I will do my best to fix them promptly. I felt that I covered most issues within the program, but of course problems may occur.

As the developer, I want to hear the feedback from the user! I am open to suggestions for improving the program. This is my first program as of right now and I want to know how I can improve. I was unsure about deleting the first/second date lines when you click on the text box, so please give me some feedback on it!
